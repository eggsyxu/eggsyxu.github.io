## Seven Deadly Sins
> _Note:_ This poem draws upon Christian and biblical imagery to explore the cruelty of public judgment, hypocrisy, and moral theater in modern society. It is not a critique of faith or the sacred, but a lament for how sacred language is often misused to punish rather than to heal.  


_(For Those Born with Malice in Their Veins)_

Nailed to the cross of spit and blame—  
for failing to halt death’s choreography.  
Testimonies pile into gallows,  
each barbed punctuation a crown of thorns,  
no advocate in this masquerade tribunal.

Marble judgment seats sprout hypocrite-hatched fungi:  
the most elitist mold preaches against elitism,  
the clique-forming spores chant unity hymns,  
the nepotism mycelium judges the competent.  
Chopin’s waltz swells the funeral bells,  
blood-caked oxfords and stilettos

spin ecstatically,  
autographing air with inked claws.

My confession chokes at the Adam’s apple—  
I denounce this guilt,  
for you all cradle sins in your marrow  
while posing as cherubs.

You faux-penitents,  
who claim to witness death’s descent  
yet quiver with voyeuristic rapture—  
invent hemorrhaging grammars  
to suture soul-cracks too vile to behold.  
Sermonizing in virtue’s stolen robes,  
you magnify my crimes,  
flog my dignity,  
sentence me with maggot-riddled gavels!

My ribs, stripped bare,  
etch with nursery rhymes dipped in arsenic.  
Children kick balls of testicle-leather,  
rats sup duodenum stew with silver spoons.

A bronze bell charring in stratospheric flames—  
God keeps his porcelain silence.  
On yellowed parchment, every period  
blinks festering eyes,  
beaming at the carnival of human rot.

## The Boy on Riverside South Road

_(Dedicated to my carefree days in elementary school)_

On a whim, I wandered back into my old elementary school.  
The buildings and playground stood in the rain, slowly withering.  
Everything looked just as it did in memories from ten years ago.  
I walked the corridors I’d tried to escape from in countless dreams—  
This time, I finally had the chance  
to retrieve the fragments buried deepest in my memory.  
So I read the worn-out pages in a dim-lit reading room,  
So I played songs of farewell for lost souls in the music room.

I paced toward the dome that once split my head in pain.  
My mouth dry,  
I frantically pressed the drinking fountain, rusty for years.  
Out poured muddy water, bitter with dew.

The only thing that changed was the art classroom—  
Now holy and pristine in its renovation.  
But I still couldn't stop the tears.  
For it was the scent of childhood,  
the warmth of a womb.

The final days of sixth grade smelled of pine needles.  
Kites drifted lazily in the sunlight.  
Children played hide-and-seek in the grass-scented woods.  
A boy and girl embraced softly on the rooftop.

Leaving the school, I strolled through the rain,  
And an old Taiwanese snack shop that had lasted twenty years found me.  
Time leaves no trace on the tongue.  
For a fleeting second,  
I was still that carefree boy.

## To the Ants

A seething mass of black heads—daylight’s final flicker.  
The white sanctuary entombs the spirits of pioneers.  
Do not ravenously seek nectar not meant for you.  
If you insist, let this be the last sunset you taste.

If I have offended you tonight,  
do not resent me.  
I, too, once hesitated.  
I, too, trembled in uneasy breath.

But you stole what was mine—  
gnawed at hours I meant to discard.
