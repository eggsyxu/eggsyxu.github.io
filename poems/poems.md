## Prologue

**The poems published on this website are excerpts from my already published poetry collection.**

It’s been three years since I wrote the preface to the first edition of the book—three years since the college entrance exam.  
Life is divided by self-defined chapters: three years of middle school, three of high school, three of college. Senior year, with few classes, I labeled as my first step into society.  
College finally pulled me out of a meaningless life, giving me more time to do the things I love. My only regret is not reading enough outside of class. Most of the time, my days were filled with academic books. Although those texts also gave me great fulfillment and satisfied my thirst for knowledge, I often thought: if I could explore a broader intellectual world during this final window of youth, it would be a blessing.  
As for how I began writing poetry, I vaguely remember it started around 2017, my final year of middle school. That was when my mind was awakening, and the pressure was immense. Li Bai once said, “Literature despises those with smooth paths in life.” I think the poems I wrote back then were quite immature, since my real hardships—those repetitive rock-bottom days—had not yet begun.  
Back to poetry. I believe anyone has the right to write poems—majestic ones, borrowed ones, angry ones, or gentle ones. I admire them all. Perhaps I wouldn’t love reading every single one, but I deeply respect and embrace the tradition of poetry that has accompanied human civilization since its birth. Everyone deserves a chance to leave their emotions and stories in history, regardless of whether someone will ever unearth them.  
Of course, to be honest, what matters most isn't the connection to history—but the connection to yourself. Before cameras, poetry was the best tool of memory—not as cold as prose, but a vessel of soul.  
For me, poetry is almost instinctive. I’m highly sensitive to the world around me. My spirit is resilient enough to bear strong shocks, so I can amplify delicate emotions without self-destruction. In this sense, I believe I have a gift.  
My poetry rarely follows structure—I write as thoughts arise. I once tried a traditional poetic form called *Manjianghong*, but ended up too embarrassed to continue. I’ve always disliked ornate rhetoric and obscure allusions (perhaps because I lack the ability and feel jealous). Tang poetry is full of these, so I never really clicked with it as a child. I prefer Song lyrics—they’re strict with rhyme, but never feel suffocating. Foreign poetry is wonderful, too. Though translations lose some native beauty, they remain wonderfully free.  
Back in 2017, my poems were often a blend of stolen lines and borrowed phrases. Now, they make me laugh—but back then, I was proud of them. After the high school entrance exam, I met my “captain,” Mr. Xu Tao. He probably doesn’t remember me, but I have to mention him. He was my first real mentor, who guided us through poetry, films, and essays. Thanks to him, my talent—whatever that word means—was fully ignited.  
That was when I realized I needed to pause and absorb more. I read many books. My life at that time, from a worldly view, was at a low point. Pain made me more attuned to subtle emotions and beauty. I believe that was my poetic awakening.  
In high school, my poems were always *distant and misty*. That may sound vague, but it’s the best term I could find. That kind of ambiguous beauty—ethereal, untouchable, and intoxicating. At that point in life, I wasn’t angry at the world—I was wrapped in a transparent bubble, an otherworldly sanctuary. So all my poetry was rooted in that utopia, filled with the kind of distance and loveliness one can only remember.  
Back then, I believed girls were beautiful. They were frequent guests in my poems, neighbors in films. Without them, half of my poems would never have been born. To all the beautiful girls of my high school: even if you’ve lost joy, reason, or spirit now—your former selves live forever in my ink.  
Sometimes, I feel like I’ve lost my muse. I’ve devoted my inspiration to this grounded land. I’ve begun to *rage against the dying of the light*. These newer poems, in hindsight, are mostly negative. Poetry became a vessel for my emotions—a bridge between dream and reality. It no longer recorded beauty, but instead expressed pain and madness. It became a place for confusion at waking, for the weight of realism, for rage and critique. Not beauty, but affliction.  
I know every writer has this phase. While I don’t claim to be a writer, I didn’t expect this suffering to come so early in adulthood. Even when my poems recall beautiful memories, I only want to cling to them—relive yesterday. Like a time machine that can never exist.  
And now, I remember why I wanted to write this prologue. Why I made this collection—maybe it’s more of an anthology. Whether life is painful, joyful, or dull, I believe my life is worth remembering. I won’t cast myself as the protagonist of my life. I love that title, but such arrogance would suggest my suffering existed only to shape me—and I reject that.  
We all search for proof that we were here. Mine is in every page. Though fragmented, and though I believe poetry is deeply personal, it is real. I hope my future self can see who I truly was. I hope *you*, now, can see who I was. Of course, I also *don’t* hope you see who I was—because all this sentimentality is only here out of pre-publication decorum.  
I always hoped this preface would end seriously,  
so I added this line—one that even makes me laugh.

*I hope you enjoy it.*

## Seven Deadly Sins
> _Note:_ This poem draws upon Christian and biblical imagery to explore the cruelty of public judgment, hypocrisy, and moral theater in modern society. It is not a critique of faith or the sacred, but a lament for how sacred language is often misused to punish rather than to heal.  


_(For Those Born with Malice in Their Veins)_

Nailed to the cross of spit and blame—  
for failing to halt death’s choreography.  
Testimonies pile into gallows,  
each barbed punctuation a crown of thorns,  
no advocate in this masquerade tribunal.

Marble judgment seats sprout hypocrite-hatched fungi:  
the most elitist mold preaches against elitism,  
the clique-forming spores chant unity hymns,  
the nepotism mycelium judges the competent.  
Chopin’s waltz swells the funeral bells,  
blood-caked oxfords and stilettos

spin ecstatically,  
autographing air with inked claws.

My confession chokes at the Adam’s apple—  
I denounce this guilt,  
for you all cradle sins in your marrow  
while posing as cherubs.

You faux-penitents,  
who claim to witness death’s descent  
yet quiver with voyeuristic rapture—  
invent hemorrhaging grammars  
to suture soul-cracks too vile to behold.  
Sermonizing in virtue’s stolen robes,  
you magnify my crimes,  
flog my dignity,  
sentence me with maggot-riddled gavels!

My ribs, stripped bare,  
etch with nursery rhymes dipped in arsenic.  
Children kick balls of testicle-leather,  
rats sup duodenum stew with silver spoons.

A bronze bell charring in stratospheric flames—  
God keeps his porcelain silence.  
On yellowed parchment, every period  
blinks festering eyes,  
beaming at the carnival of human rot.

## The Boy on Riverside South Road

_(Dedicated to my carefree days in elementary school)_

On a whim, I wandered back into my old elementary school.  
The buildings and playground stood in the rain, slowly withering.  
Everything looked just as it did in memories from ten years ago.  
I walked the corridors I’d tried to escape from in countless dreams—  
This time, I finally had the chance  
to retrieve the fragments buried deepest in my memory.  
So I read the worn-out pages in a dim-lit reading room,  
So I played songs of farewell for lost souls in the music room.

I paced toward the dome that once split my head in pain.  
My mouth dry,  
I frantically pressed the drinking fountain, rusty for years.  
Out poured muddy water, bitter with dew.

The only thing that changed was the art classroom—  
Now holy and pristine in its renovation.  
But I still couldn't stop the tears.  
For it was the scent of childhood,  
the warmth of a womb.

The final days of sixth grade smelled of pine needles.  
Kites drifted lazily in the sunlight.  
Children played hide-and-seek in the grass-scented woods.  
A boy and girl embraced softly on the rooftop.

Leaving the school, I strolled through the rain,  
And an old Taiwanese snack shop that had lasted twenty years found me.  
Time leaves no trace on the tongue.  
For a fleeting second,  
I was still that carefree boy.

## Testimony

_(For All Who Dwell in Time)_

I’ve witnessed petals wilting one by one,  
waves collapsing into mute oblivion—  
my poem always begins with "I".

I’ve seen ninety-year-old death,  
fifty-year-old voids,  
twenty-year-old ruins.  
My verses still return to me.

Life is dopamine’s downward spiral,  
genes’ indentured servant,  
a thirst for eternity’s mirage.  
Life’s first breath is death’s last gasp.

## Escape

I was imprisoned in a jail,  
with only six months left on my sentence.  
Impatiently, I began plotting an escape.  
Each dawn, we would slip out one by one.  
In the end, only one other was as resolute as me—  
we made it to the outer edge of the prison wall.  
But I found I could not scale it.  
The guards caught me in time, gripping me tightly.

Back inside, I was met with jeers and scorn.  
Then I was told  
another inmate had died  
in pursuit of freedom.

So they invited me to a banquet of memories,  
a feast lit by flames and thick with charcoal smoke.  
I saw my nimble, slender grandmother—  
her hands deft, her movements light.  
I witnessed a flower suddenly collapse and wither.  
I caught a glimpse of lingering resentment  
refusing to leave the world,  
and a hallucination of despair, chaos,  
and time bleeding into itself.

## Record

When I’m happy, I don’t write poems—  
the camera records every second and every smile.  
When I’m in pain, I don’t take photos—  
poems capture the fractured fragments instead.  
When I’m deep in thought, I just stare into space.

And when I think of myself  
on some planet  
in some faraway universe,  
I can’t help but smile.  
Every cloned version of me  
deserves to be just as happy.

## Elegy to the Motherland 

> _Note:_ This elegy is not a political assertion. No nation is free from the weight of history. This elegy is not written in blame, but in mourning—for dreams faded, ideals misplaced, and the silence that follows. No place is named. Every place is.  

Beneath the bridge,  
the coexistence faction sings the Internationale—  
an elegy,  
an elegy to souls weightless and drifting afar.

In dreams, comrades ask me  
about the past in Leningrad.  
I answer with tales of failed revolutions  
and the halted flow of the Dnieper.  
But the dead cannot slit their own throats—  
they are forever tormented by sparks  
that once meant hope.

In search of answers,  
I travel to the homeland of freedom,  
but order is gone.

So the elimination faction  
stands at the edge of Siberia,  
denouncing—  
denouncing those who rot in power  
beside their piles of gold.

## Who Am I

I am a numb traveler,  
an irritable warrior.  
My heart pounds like thunder,  
sweat pours down like rain.

I loathe what is beautiful,  
yet long to conquer it.  
I am tonight’s voiceless fury.

Now I am bound by desire,  
tomorrow I shall be bound by reality.  
I am one of many passengers  
in the net and the cycle of return.

## Our Struggle

_(For a friend)_

We run—  
through daylight and darkness alike.  
Three-quarters of the sky,  
from orange to midnight blue,  
from silence to uproar.

We speak of the future,  
of all we know  
about the unknown.  

As a romantic absolutist,  
as a revolutionary misfit,  
you must crush the howls and pride of strangers in foreign lands.  
Tell them what peace you need—  
the kind that visits you  
each night  
in your quiet solitude.

## To the Ants

A seething mass of black heads—daylight’s final flicker.  
The white sanctuary entombs the spirits of pioneers.  
Do not ravenously seek nectar not meant for you.  
If you insist, let this be the last sunset you taste.

If I have offended you tonight,  
do not resent me.  
I, too, once hesitated.  
I, too, trembled in uneasy breath.

But you stole what was mine—  
gnawed at hours I meant to discard.

## Song of Sorrow

Orchids at midnight,  
a forest of pitch.  
The distant beacons of war  
and tonight’s broken moon.

Offer these colors to the withering Titans.  
Melt my sorrow into the barren soil.  
Grant rebirth to what has long since slept.  
Let my wishes collide with the stars,  
and spill them into the sky.

I shall drink the sacred water,  
and wait alone for judgment.  
Please do not disturb the silence of my repentance,  
for forgiveness arrives only at night.

May the you in time still pray for me,  
and bring me back  
to Eden overgrown with ginkgo trees.

## The Whisper of Summer

The winter sun once seemed gentle—  
now it devours my flesh.  
What was once smooth as an egg  
is now withered and coarse.

The hot, dry oxygen  
fills my dying sighs,  
relentlessly scorching my soul.  
Only a numb skeleton moves forward.

I long to scream,  
to speak the world’s injustice, its evil, its rage and absurdity,  
to name its vanity, hypocrisy, vengeance and selfishness.

Cicadas hum with the moonlight,  
whispering soft and slow.  
Their rhythmic song  
tells of an ordinary summer night—  
and mocks  
an ordinary me.

## Negative Energy

A churning, twisted wave of gray  
pounds against the fortress I once thought unbreakable.  
Nicotine and alcohol—  
neither can scatter the eternal night.

Silent beneath the stars,  
I gaze at the hem of the gods' robes.  
Green aircraft slice across the sky,  
leaving only trembling and submission behind.

Hormones and dopamine  
devour the last of my reason.  
I want to sail, to drift, to flee.  
I want to cry, to die, to be buried.

Negative energy—who are you?  
You give me power—  
and despair.
