## Seven Deadly Sins

_(For Those Born with Malice in Their Veins)_

Nailed to the cross of spit and blame—  
for failing to halt death’s choreography.  
Testimonies pile into gallows,  
each barbed punctuation a crown of thorns,  
no advocate in this masquerade tribunal.

Marble judgment seats sprout hypocrite-hatched fungi:  
the most elitist mold preaches against elitism,  
the clique-forming spores chant unity hymns,  
the nepotism mycelium judges the competent.  
Chopin’s waltz swells the funeral bells,  
blood-caked oxfords and stilettos

spin ecstatically,  
autographing air with inked claws.

My confession chokes at the Adam’s apple—  
I denounce this guilt,  
for you all cradle sins in your marrow  
while posing as cherubs.

You faux-penitents,  
who claim to witness death’s descent  
yet quiver with voyeuristic rapture—  
invent hemorrhaging grammars  
to suture soul-cracks too vile to behold.  
Sermonizing in virtue’s stolen robes,  
you magnify my crimes,  
flog my dignity,  
sentence me with maggot-riddled gavels!

My ribs, stripped bare,  
etch with nursery rhymes dipped in arsenic.  
Children kick balls of testicle-leather,  
rats sup duodenum stew with silver spoons.

A bronze bell charring in stratospheric flames—  
God keeps his porcelain silence.  
On yellowed parchment, every period  
blinks festering eyes,  
beaming at the carnival of human rot.

## To the Ants

A seething mass of black heads—daylight’s final flicker.  
The white sanctuary entombs the spirits of pioneers.  
Do not ravenously seek nectar not meant for you.  
If you insist, let this be the last sunset you taste.

If I have offended you tonight,  
do not resent me.  
I, too, once hesitated.  
I, too, trembled in uneasy breath.

But you stole what was mine—  
gnawed at hours I meant to discard.
