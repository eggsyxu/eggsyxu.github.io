### Reinforcement Learning & SNN for Autonomous Driving  

Developed autonomous driving decision algorithms with reinforcement learning and Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). Designed a custom motor controller and USB communication hub for Jetson Orin NX, interfacing with radar and camera sensors. Successfully validated the SNN-based decision-making in scaled-down sandbox environments.

### EMG-Controlled Robotic Arm for Grasping Tasks  
**GitHub:** [View Project](https://github.com/eggsyxu/EMG_Signal_Control_Robotics_Arm)

Designed a bio-interfacing control system for a 4-DOF robotic arm using EMG signals from the human hand. Developed custom amplification and band-pass filtering circuits, implemented rule-based signal classification to identify muscle activation patterns, and mapped them to robotic arm commands including forward, backward, lateral motion, and grasp. Applied forward kinematics to achieve precise real-time control of the end-effector.
