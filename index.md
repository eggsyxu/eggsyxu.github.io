My name is Guangxuan (Eggsy) Xu. Welcome to my world! 

I’m currently a master’s student at the University of Michigan, pursuing a dual degree in Robotics and Biomedical Engineering. 

My research focuses on legged robots, bio-sensing driven prosthetics, and robotic arms. I received my bachelor’s degree in Measurement, Control, and Instrumentation from Sichuan University, and previously worked as a visiting student at Westlake University under the supervision of Professor Mohamad Sawan.

Outside of academics, I have a wide range of interests, especially in motorsports. I enjoy racing, drifting, jet skiing, and snowmobiling, as well as playing badminton, photography, and exploring home theater audio systems.
